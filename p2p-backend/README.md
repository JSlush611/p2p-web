# Point to La Pointe Data Visulization
Small scraping project I made for a open water swim in Bayfield, WI. Allows you to visualize historical data using various pre-defined graphs.

## To Use
Run `python3 analyze_swim_data.py` after editing the `main` function to pick which graphs you want to use, and what specific swimmer you want to analyze.
Runn `python3 util.py clear_graphs` to clear the graphs in your chosen directory.
